                 </p>
                 <p>Maximal Security Services built the Maximal app as a reporting system for security officers, company management, and clients.</p>
        <p>This page is used to inform users of the app regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>    
            
        <p>Information Collection and Use</p>
            
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Name, Home Address, Phone Number. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>
            
            <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

            <p>Log Data</p>
            
            <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>
            
            <p>Data Security Policies</p>
            
            <p>Data security is very important to us at Maximal. The data we have been entrusted is personal, identifiable, private, and we strive to take every step we can to protect the integrity and privacy of that data. It is a large and important part of how</p>
            <p>we build our applications and run our business. Specific policies are listed and
            described below, but the overall summary is that all of it is to support the ultimate
            end goal of the safe care of our customers’ data.</p>
            
            <p>OWASP awareness</p>
            <p>As a software company powered primarily by web apis (HTTPS), we are subject to a
            whole ecosystem of threats and potential vulnerabilities. The OWASP top ten list is a
            great resource for being up to date on the understanding of those attack vectors, so
            we can properly protect against them.</p>
            
            <p>Regular software updates</p>
            <p>We make sure that we are not ever running out–of–security–update software. We keep
            up to date on news of critical security (“zero day”) patches and apply them as quickly
            as possible to our server footprint</p>
            
             
            <p>Authenticate and Authorize by default</p>
            <p>One of the most common data leak vulnerabilities is a broken, missing, or otherwise
            malfunctioning auth layer. In our app, authentication is baked in by default in a
            middleware layer to ensure it is not accidentally skipped to developer error.
            Generalizing this policy, application architecture is always designed such that security will come by default.</p>
             
            <p>Use proven security technologies</p>
            <p>We may use cutting–edge or more exotic technology in some parts of our application, 
            but NOT where security is concerned. Our security–focused sections of our
            architecture are always using technology that has been battle–tested, proven, and has numerous corporations in the community also using the same technology and contributing to regular updates.</p>

            <p>
            We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
